# Model Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
This project aims to optimize the hyperparameters of a model using GridSearchCV to ensure the selection of the best hyperparameters. The GridSearchCV method tests various combinations of hyperparameter values and selects the best one that yields the best results.

Project Description
In this project, hyperparameters are optimized using GridSearchCV by searching through different parameter combinations. This method is very useful for ensuring that the model is properly tuned and provides accurate results.

Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

scikit-learn: For model building and hyperparameter optimization.
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For basic mathematical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
Project Steps
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded using pandas, and initial analysis is performed.
Missing values are cleaned or filled with appropriate values.
Model Selection and Hyperparameters:

Based on the data analysis, an appropriate model is selected.
Various hyperparameters are defined for the model (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth).

The GridSearchCV method is used to test different combinations of hyperparameters.
The best hyperparameters are selected to optimize the model.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset.
The model with the best performance is selected, and the results are presented.
